<h2 id=divingin>Diving In</h2>

<p class=f><img src=i/aoc-w.png alt=W width=110 height=109>hat is <abbr>HTML5</abbr>? <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is the next generation of <abbr>HTML</abbr>, superseding <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.01, <abbr>XHTML</abbr> 1.0, and <abbr>XHTML</abbr> 1.1. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> provides new features that are necessary for modern web applications. It also standardizes many features of the web platform that web developers have been using for years, but which have never been vetted or documented by a standards committee. (Would it surprise you to learn that the <code>Window</code> object has never been formally documented? In addition to the new features, <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is the first attempt to formally document many of the &#8220;de facto&#8221; standards that web browsers have supported for years.)

<p>Like its predecessors, <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is designed to be cross-platform. You don&#8217;t need to be running Windows or Mac OS X or Linux or Multics or any particular operating system in order to take advantage of <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. The only thing you <em>do</em> need is a modern web browser. There are modern web browsers available for free for all major operating systems. You may already have a web browser that supports certain <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features. The latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera all support many <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features. (You&#8217;ll find more detailed browser compatibility tables throughout this book.) The mobile web browsers that come pre-installed on iPhones, iPads, and Android phones all have excellent support for <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. Even Microsoft has announced that the upcoming version 9 of Internet Explorer will support some <abbr>HTML5</abbr> functionality.

<p>This book will focus on eight topics:

<ol>
<li><a href=semantics.html>New semantic elements</a> like <code>&lt;header></code>, <code>&lt;footer></code>, and <code>&lt;section></code>
<li><a href=canvas.html>Canvas</a>, a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program with JavaScript
<li><a href=video.html>Video</a> that you can embed on your web pages without resorting to third-party plugins
<li><a href=geolocation.html>Geolocation</a>, whereby visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web application
<li><a href=storage.html>Persistent local storage</a> without resorting to third-party plugins
<li><a href=offline.html>Offline web applications</a> that work even after network access is interrupted
<li><a href=forms.html>Improvements to <abbr>HTML</abbr> web forms</a>
<li><a href=extensibility.html>Microdata</a>, which lets you create your own vocabularies beyond <abbr>HTML5</abbr> and extend your web pages with custom semantics
</ol>

<p><abbr>HTML5</abbr> is designed, as much as possible, to be backward compatible with existing web browsers. New features build on existing features and allow you to provide fallback content for older browsers. If you need even greater control, you can <a href=detect.html>detect support for individual <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features</a> using a few lines of JavaScript. Don&#8217;t rely on fragile browser sniffing to decide which browsers support <abbr>HTML5</abbr>! Instead, test for the features you need using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> itself.

<p>Ready? <a href=past.html>Let&#8217;s dive in</a>.
