<p>This isn&#8217;t really written yet, but here are some rough notes:

<ul>
<li>HTML5 is the next generation of HTML, superceding HTML 4.1/XHTML whatever. It's designed to provide new features that are necessary for modern web applications, particularly mobile applications. Nothing in here may seem terribly new to you, because there have been workarounds for a lot of this stuff.
<li>In particular: Canvas, database, forms, location, video, whatever. Integrated into HTML (and JavaScript), not hacked in. Why this is good.
<li>Being adopted by everyone who's anyone, except IE, and not everywhere at the same rate; Smartphones most advanced.
<li>I'm going to show you all the new markup, with lots of examples, and particular attention to backward compatibility.
</ul>
